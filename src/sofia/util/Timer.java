/**
 * <p>
 * This class provides a very simple API for calling methods either once or
 * repeatedly after a delay. Instead of creating objects of this class using
 * the {@code new} keyword, you can use the following static "factory" methods
 * to queue up delayed method calls in the background:
 * </p>
 * <dl>
 * <dt>{@code callOnce(Object receiver, String methodName, long delay)}</dt>
 * <dd>Requests that an object's method be called once after a number of
 * milliseconds has passed.</dd>
 * <dt>{@code callRepeatedly(Object receiver, String methodName,
 * long delay)}</dt>
 * <dd>Requests that an object's method be called repeatedly after a number of
 * milliseconds has passed.</dd>
 * <dt>{@code callRepeatedly(Object receiver, String methodName,
 * long initialDelay, long repeatDelay)}</dt>
 * <dd>Requests that an object's method be called repeatedly, with separate
 * controls over the initial delay (before the first call) and the repeat
 * delay (between subsequent calls).</dd>
 * </dl>
 * <p>
 * Each of these methods returns a {@code Timer} object, which can be stored
 * and used later if necessary. For example, you may want to keep the timer
 * in a field so that you can stop the repetition in response to a user action
 * (like a button click) or some other external event.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Methods the timer can call</h3>
 * <p>
 * The method whose name is passed to these factory methods must be public,
 * take no arguments, and return either {@code void} or {@code boolean}. Be
 * careful: if a method with the correct name is found but the arguments do not
 * match, then no error will be produced at runtime, and the method will simply
 * not be called.
 * </p><p>
 * The version of the method that returns {@code boolean} is useful for timers
 * created by {@code callRepeatedly}. In this case, returning {@code true} will
 * cause the timer to stop (and the method will not be called again), or
 * returning {@code true} will cause the timer to continue processing and fire
 * again after the delay. If the method returns {@code void} instead, then the
 * timer will run indefinitely, until it is stopped by calling {@link #stop()}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Automatic lifecycle management</h3>
 * <p>
 * If the <strong>receiver</strong> for the timed method call is a
 * {@link Screen}, then the timer will be automatically managed as part of the
 * screen's lifecycle; the timer will be paused and resumed automatically
 * during the screen's {@code onPause} and {@code onResume} methods,
 * respectively.
 * </p><p>
 * If the method receiver is another object, then you will manually pause and
 * resume the timer. Backing out of an activity or leaving the application does
 * <strong>not</strong> automatically stop the timer, in most cases.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Threading concerns</h3>
 * <p>
 * Timed methods are always called on the main GUI thread, regardless of which
 * thread they are started on. This is to avoid problems when users might want
 * to start timed method calls on the physics thread (for example, in reaction
 * to a collision between shapes).
 * </p>
